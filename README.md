LiveSituation
=============

Rethinking real-time incident coverage.

Getting Started
---------------

For now, LiveSituation's front-end application server is built on node.js.
If you haven't already, [install node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).
After that, head into your friendly terminal and type:

```
npm install
```

Finally, start up the development server:

```
grunt dev
```

You'll be able to access the development version of the app at
[http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/).
Any changes you make to the code while `grunt dev` is running
should appear right when you refresh the page.
